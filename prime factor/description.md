# Prime Factor
A research, somehow, by @frainmaster.

Prime Factor
- prime numbers that made up another non-prime number.
- `e.g.` : 6 is made up of 2 prime factors, `2` and `3` (`2 * 3 = 6`)

# 
### Program
1. The program will prompt user to print a number, `x`. This number will be used to traverse `a` and `b` from 0 to it. So, the triples that
is going to be created will have its `a` and `b` below `x`.

2. After the number input, the program will right away output the list of possible triples.

### Misc

What is the prime factor of prime numbers?
> Prime factor of prime numbers is itself.

> `e.g.` : `47` is a prime number, and it is made up of `1 * 47`, and there are no other numbers that can divide `47` and give 0 balance.
