# Prime Factor
Another research, somehow, by @frainmaster.

Prime Factor
- prime numbers that made up another non-prime number.
- `e.g.` : 6 is made up of 2 prime factors, `2` and `3` (`2 * 3 = 6`)

# 
### Program
1. The program will prompt user to print a number, `num`. The number will be divided right away to its prime factors.

2. The program will not stop until you put `0` as the input to end the program.

# 
### Misc

What is the prime factor of prime numbers?
> Prime factor of prime numbers is itself.

> `e.g.` : `47` is a prime number, and it is made up of `1 * 47`, and there are no other numbers that can divide `47` and give 0 balance.

What will happen if I input a negative number or decimal?

> It will display error message `number is not a positive integer` and will continue asking the next number.
